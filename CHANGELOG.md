# Changelog

## 1.0.8

- completed the Node-only runtime migration
- removed legacy shell lifecycle entrypoints and gate wrappers
- aligned bootstrap, install, init, reinit, verify, update, uninstall, and gate flows on `bin/octopus.js`
- reduced the deployed bundle surface to `bin/`, `src/`, `template/`, and core docs
- refreshed contract tests and documentation for the Node-only runtime

## Current Direction

- Node.js 20 LTS is the only runtime baseline
- lifecycle commands and gates run only through the Node CLI
- `scripts/node-foundation/*` remains only as repository build/test infrastructure
